Advanced JavaScript Tasks
1. Recursion & Stack
Factorial Function (Recursion) – Implement factorial calculation using recursion.
Fibonacci Sequence – Find the nth Fibonacci number recursively.
Climbing Stairs Problem – Count ways to climb stairs using recursion.
Flatten a Nested Array – Write a recursive function to flatten an array.
Tower of Hanoi – Solve the Tower of Hanoi problem using recursion.


2. JSON & Spread Syntax
Sum with Variable Arguments – Use rest parameters to sum any number of values.
Sum an Array using Spread Syntax – Pass an array of numbers using spread.
Deep Clone an Object – Use JSON.parse(JSON.stringify()).
Merge Two Objects – Combine two objects using spread syntax.
Serialize and Parse JSON – Convert a JS object to JSON and back.


3. Closures
Returning Functions – Create a function that returns another function.
Counter Using Closure – Implement a counter with private variables.
Multiple Counters – Ensure each counter maintains its own count.
Private Variables with Closures – Prevent access to internal variables.
Function Factory – Create functions dynamically based on input.


4. Promises & Async/Await
Basic Promise – Resolve after a delay with a message.
Fetching API Data – Fetch data using Promises and process it.
Randomly Resolving/Rejection – Create a Promise that randomly resolves or rejects.
Promise.all for Parallel Requests – Fetch multiple resources in parallel.
Chained Promises – Perform multiple asynchronous actions sequentially.


5. Async/Await
Convert Promise to Async/Await – Rewrite a promise function using async/await.
Fetch & Process API Data – Use await to fetch and manipulate data.
Error Handling in Async Functions – Use try/catch in async/await.
Promise.all with Async/Await – Fetch multiple APIs concurrently.
Multiple Async Operations – Wait for multiple asynchronous calls before proceeding.


6. JavaScript Modules
Exporting Functions, Classes, Variables – Create a module with exports.
Importing Modules – Use import in another JS file.
Named Exports – Export multiple functions using named exports.
Named Imports – Import specific functions from a module.
Default Export & Import – Use export default for a primary function.
